        <p>
            Your Net IDE Package project has been successfully generated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your project is now configured to be compiled and started as
            a Net IDE Package. However, one piece of configuration is still
            missing. If this is a <b>Core</b> package for a new Net IDE
            application, the <b>context</b> for this package still needs to be
            registered. In a production environment, this registration would be
            done through the setup, but for a development environment, this must
            be done by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            These steps only apply if this is a <b>Core</b> package. For plugins
            to an existing application, you need to have the application installed,
            which already ensures that the context has been registered.
        </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Locate the full output path of your project. This is the
                    <span class="code">bin\Debug</span> directory in your project.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Open the Registry Editor.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Locate the path <span class="code">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Net IDE</span>.
                    If it does not exist yet, create it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Under the <span class="code">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Net IDE</span>
                    key, create a new key with the name of your context.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Under the context key, create a new <b>String Value</b>
                    with the name <span class="code">InstallationPath</span>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Change the value of the <span class="code">InstallationPath</span>
                    String Value to the full output path of your project.
                </p>
